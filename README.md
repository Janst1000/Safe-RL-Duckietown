# Safe-RL-Duckietown

### Introduction

### Setup

For our model based reinforcement learning we are using a linear regression model to estimate the new position of the duckiebot given an action  (linear_v, angular_v). For this we have to load in a model or collect data and compute a new model. You can load in the model of my duckiebot by just using the model.npz file in the config folder of our rl_agent package.
